# RL-Trader-for-Kalshi-Bitcoin-Hourly-Markets

Reinforcement Learning Trader for Kalshi is an end-to-end autonomous trading system that applies deep reinforcement learning to Bitcoin hourly prediction markets on Kalshi. The project formulates trading as a Markov Decision Process and trains a PPO-based actor–critic agent within a custom Gymnasium environment using historical BTC price data, technical indicators, and contract probabilities. The trained policy is deployed to the Kalshi demo environment via the official API, executing trades in real time while a Streamlit dashboard visualizes market states, agent actions, and portfolio P&L. This project demonstrates how reinforcement learning can be applied to real-world prediction markets, combining backtesting, live deployment, and interactive monitoring in a single pipeline.
